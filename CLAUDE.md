### Use Serena MCP for Semantic Code Analysis instead of regular code search and editing

Serena MCP is available for advanced code retrieval and editing capabilities.

**When to use Serena:**
- Symbol-based code navigation (find definitions, references, implementations)
- Precise code manipulation in structured codebases
- Prefer symbol-based operations over file-based grep/sed when available

**Key tools:**
- `find_symbol` - Find symbol by name across the codebase
- `find_referencing_symbols` - Find all symbols that reference a given symbol
- `get_symbols_overview` - Get overview of top-level symbols in a file
- `read_file` - Read file content within the project directory

**Usage notes:**
- Memory files can be manually reviewed/edited in `.serena/memories/`
